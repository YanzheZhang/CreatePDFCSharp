	 * <CODE>PdfProcSet</CODE> is the PDF ProcSet object.
	 * <P>
	 * The types of instructions that may be used in a PDF marking context are grouped
	 * into independent sets of related instructions. Each of these sets, called a ProcSet,
	 * may or may not be used in a particular context. ProcSets contain implementations of
	 * the PDF operators and are used only when a page or other context is printed.
	 * The Resources Dictionary for each conext must contain a <B>ProcSet</B> key whose
	 * value is an array consisting of the names of the ProcSets used in that context.
	 * Each of the entries in the array must be one of the predefined names that are
	 * contained in this class as static membervariables.<BR>
	 * This object is described in the 'Portable Document Format Reference Manual version 1.3'
	 * section 7.6 (page 198).
